# Pig-Gamble
It's a game of 2-10 players where a dice is rolled, based on which a player wins.
It's a Command Line Interface game... I will try to make a GUI but it's already available in the market made by other developers.

# Rules of the game are as follows:
  - Enter the number of players (2-4) to start a new game.
  - During your turn, enter 'y' to roll the dice and 'n' to stop.
  - The first one to get a non-zero score wins! Only if the other players get zero in their turns. Now enjoy!!
  - '/help' - Displays this help menu.
  - '/exit' - Exits the game at any point.
